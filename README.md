# 42_transcendence

We, a team of 5 teammates, have coded our latest project from école 42 common-core.
We had to make a webApp with a chat and the legendary game of Pong.

Vue.js was used for the frontend. We also used modules such as Pinia and tailwind.
The backend was made with Nest.js, Prisma and with a PostgreSQL db.

We also decided to manage this project with GitProject and the SCRUM method.
Notion and Figma also allowed us to manage well all information and design.
The teamwork went very well. Some made more frontend and some more backend but overall we've all seen a bit of everything.

It was a rewarding and fun experience and we really learned a LOT.

[Check out our website here](https://cloud.davifarhi.ch/) and ask a friend to come with you. it's difficult to chat and play if you are alone on the webApp. You will first have to create a user (the right button). Enjoy!
